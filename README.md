# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

Fourth project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency.

In this project we built a thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections.

This project was developed inside a Docker container which took care of all the local package dependencies.

## Basic Build

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the following command in your terminal when using Linux: `xhost +` (This will allow you to run a GUI application within Docker but seeing it in your screen)
3. Run: `docker-compose up`
